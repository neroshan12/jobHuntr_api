# jobHuntr-api

The aim of this project is to build on the jobhuntr app I created when I initially left Makers Academy. I am looking to build a simple CRUD api that will allow users to keep track of jobs they are applying for.

## User Stories

## Running the application (locally)

## Future features

- Create - POST job
- Read - GET job, jobs
- Update - PATCH job
- Delete - DELETE jobs
- Middleware (json & auth)
- User flow (Sign up, login, delete, password encryption, token)
- Deploy
- Security
